Caesar Cipher Program:
Overview -
This is a simple Caesar Cipher program written in Python. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher technique. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Features
Encrypt a message by shifting letters to the right or left.
Decrypt a message by reversing the shift.
Interactive command-line interface to choose between encryption, decryption, and exiting the program.
How It Works
The program has two main functions:

caesar_encrypt(message, key, direction='right'):

Encrypts a message by shifting letters based on the provided key.
Can shift letters to the right (default) or left.
caesar_decrypt(encrypted_message, key, direction='right'):

Decrypts a previously encrypted message by reversing the shift.
The main function provides a simple command-line interface to interact with the user.

Installation
To run this program, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from python.org.

No additional libraries are required beyond the Python standard library.
